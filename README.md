# Complex-Adaptive-System-Forest-Fire-Model-Extension

Extended the Forest Fire Extension 1 model from Netlogo 6.0 library to incorporate, random spontaneous fire start. To study fire fighting effectiveness, cretaed two separate models, first based on traditional watch towers to provide a baseline for performance and the second based to wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks proved to be a very cost-effective and efficient solution compared to the traditional watch towers.
